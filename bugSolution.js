// This is a placeholder for a solution. The actual solution requires further investigation into the root cause of the inconsistent `expo prebuild` failures.  The focus here would be implementing more robust error handling or debugging techniques to gain more insight into why the command is failing.
// For example, consider adding more verbose logging to the build process, or adding checks to identify potential conflicts or issues that might lead to the failure.
// A proper solution might involve a change to the Expo CLI itself or a better understanding of the environment in which the prebuild step is happening.
// This is a temporary workaround â€“ a proper solution has yet to be determined.
