While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message wasn't very specific, simply stating that the prebuild process failed without providing details about the underlying cause. This happened inconsistently, sometimes succeeding and other times failing on the same codebase. I've tried clearing the cache, reinstalling dependencies and updating expo-cli, but none of these resolved the issue.
