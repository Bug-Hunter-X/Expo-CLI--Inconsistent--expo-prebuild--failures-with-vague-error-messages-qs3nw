# Expo CLI: Inconsistent `expo prebuild` Failures

This repository demonstrates an issue with the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command. The command fails inconsistently, providing only a generic error message, making debugging difficult.  The issue occurs across different platforms and doesn't seem to be related to a specific code structure.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo prebuild`. (This might succeed or fail randomly.)

## Potential Causes and Solutions

The root cause of this intermittent failure is currently unknown.  Possible avenues for investigation include:

* More detailed logging from the `expo prebuild` process.
* Examining platform-specific issues that might trigger the failure.
* Investigating potential conflicts with other dependencies or system settings.

The included `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a workaround that isn't a permanent fix but a step toward diagnosing the underlying issue, although a solution is not yet fully implemented.
